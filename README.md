# Graphic-Graphs
The project is called Graphic Graphs. It is an implementation project that focuses on graphs and graph algorithms.
Graphic Graphs is an interactive Java UI that allows the user to create their own graphs. Then, they can run BFS, DFS,
or Dijkstra's on their graphs and see the results. For DFS, the resulting graph will display start/finish times. For
Dijkstra's, the resulting graph will display the edge weights in the shortest path tree.
